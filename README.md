The complete monorepo for FindMyVax.ca, a COVID-19 vaccine locator used by over 55K Canadian coast to coast to coast during the height of the pandemic.

My friend and I made this vaccine locator to originally help residents of Ontario find COVID-19 vaccines during the height of the pandemic. The distribution plan for Ontario was far from ideal, there were multiple online sites each with their own inventory of vaccines, and each site didn't talk to eachother. This made finding a vaccine near you incredibly difficult; you basically had to go onto each site individually, wait in the queue, and hope there was something near you soon.

What we did was we took all the data from those sites and aggregated them onto one central site, <a href="https://findmyvax.ca">https://findmyvax.ca</a>. We let users filter searches by their postal code, how far they were willing to travel, and the type of vaccine they want (Pfizer, Moderna, etc). After a week of work, we decided to expand it to all of Canada, connecting over 25 different vaccine providers with real-time updates every second.

We sent out over 15K emails a day to users that subscribed to email notifications, and helped over 55K Canadians in just 2 short months.
